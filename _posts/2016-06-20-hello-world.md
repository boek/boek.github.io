# Hello world

I can't tell you how many times I've tried to get some sort of place to give my thoughts on just about anything that intertested me. I've tried Xynga, Myspace Blogs, [Tumblr](http://jeffboek.tumblr.com), Wordpress, Custom blog engines, you name it. But the one thing that always stopped me from actually publishing anything was perfection. 

Growing up I always had pretty high standards for myself. Always striving to be as good as the art that I appreciated. Whenever I fell short, I always hid it to side, patting myself on the back for trying but never releasing it. I didn't want to show the world my inadequacies. Or maybe I just didn't want to break the illusion to myself. Because hey, if I didn't try, how I would I ever know how far below "my mark" I would fall.

This post really resonated with me. So instead of waiting for the perfect piece, I'm going to show off the 10,000 posts it will take me to get there.

And they won't be perfect.
