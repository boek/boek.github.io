juote: 'Maybe buy an iPad..'

A friend asked me this last week when we were discussing WWDC rumors. "Besides flipping tables? Maybe buy an iPad..".

I've been carrying around a laptop since 2003 when I got this.

So I made the decision a few weeks ago to keep my work laptop at work. I was hoping to replace it at home with some new hardware rumored to be released this past week. In hindsight it makes a lot of sense why they wouldn't release it now. But I wasn't sure what I would do.

What I did know was I was not going to drop $2,000 in this situation.

Since the iPad pro was released, I've been seeing them around. But never really gave them a second thought. I had a Mini which was perfect for reading on, but I didn't use it for much else. A couple of months ago a friend of mine got the 9.7" and it's been in the back of my mind ever since. "Could I actually do _real work_ on one of those?", "Could I justify owning one?" I frequently asked myself.

I've read an [array](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-air-2-review-why-the-ipad-became-my-main-computer/) of [different](http://yieldthought.com/post/12239282034/swapped-my-macbook-for-an-ipad) [posts](http://yieldthought.com/post/31857050698/ipad-linode-1-year-later) about using an iPad as your sole machine. I've even had long conversations with friends and colleagues about doing all of your development "in the cloud". Where you would use an iPad as your terminal and do everything on another box. Well.. On Tuesday after a night of mulling it over, I actually bit the bullet and picked one up.

So you've heard this right. My only personal computing device (other than my phone) is this iPad. This will be an interesting expirement for me, but I'm excited for a few reasons. The biggest of which is becmoing truly effecient on the command line. Growing up in a GUI world I never spent a lot of time in a CLI unless I absolutely needed to be in it. Actually, that was a lie, I only use git from the command line. So I guess I do have a little familiarity in it. But this will be a nice forcing function to really feel at home sitting at one.

So I have a VPS running Ubuntu that I SSH into to write code and I have a nice smorgasboard of apps to do just about everything else I need to do.

Lastly, I'm excited to learn to write / draw / paint. For the last decade, my only creative outlet has been code. While I completely enjoy that, whenever it came time to translate my thoughts onto a whiteboard, I might as well have cut and paste hieroglyphics drawn by a four year old. It's pretty bad.

I know, I know. An iPad in itself isn't going to make me better at this. But I'm hoping that this can be a catalyst that I will use as a good starting point to build good habits.

I'm pretty excited to document this adventure. And who knows, maybe I'll continue doing it even after I get the new hardware I want.
